AI Mental Fitness Tracker
Introduction
AI Mental Fitness Tracker is a project that uses machine learning to predict the percentage of Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) attributable to mental disorders. This project aims to identify the most accurate regression model for mental health analysis. By leveraging various regression techniques, we can gain insights into the impact of specific mental and substance use disorders on overall mental health.
